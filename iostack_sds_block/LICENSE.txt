not copy any of the Documentation. The Software Product is licensed not sold.

3. RESTRICTED USE. Executing the Software on more than one computer/

not authorized to make modifications to this warranty, nor are additional
warranties binding on MPSTOR. Accordingly, additional statements such

CONDITIONS, OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY

SUPPLIERS. IF SUCH DISCLAIMER IS DISALLOWED BY A COURT OF LAW, THEN ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR
PURPOSE IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE 30-DAY WARRANTY PERIOD. Some states
do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the
above limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific
legal rights and you may have other rights, which vary from state to state.

6. CUSTOMER REMEDIES. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND MPSTOR'S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY HEREUNDER SHALL BE, UPON YOUR RETURN OF THE SOFTWARE

FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF GOOD-WILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
DATA LOSS, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, CLAIMS BY ANY PARTY OTHER THAN

OR ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. MPSTOR'S LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID

13. EFFECT OF WAIVER; SEVERABILITY. Failure by MPSTOR to enforce any
provision of this EULA shall not be deemed a waiver of that provision or
of any other provision of this EULA. Any waiver of a provision of this
EULA at a particular time or under particular circumstances shall not
have the effect of waiving any other provision, or of waiving the same
provision at a different time or under different circumstances. If any

15. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. You understand and agree that notwithstanding any
other provisions of this EULA, a breach by OEM of Section 1 (.License
Grant.) or Section 3 (.Restrictions on Use.) may cause MPSTOR irreparable
damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate. In addition
to any and all remedies available at law, MPSTOR shall be entitled, in
the event of any such breach, as a matter of right, to timely injunctive
relief or other equitable relief without the need for posting a bond in any
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent violation or contravention of
Section 1 or 2 and to compel compliance with the terms thereof by you. You
hereby irrevocable waive any defense based on the adequacy of any remedy at
law which might otherwise be asserted by MPSTOR as a bar to the remedy of
specific performance in any action brought by MPSTOR to enforce its rights
under this Section. Should you have any questions concerning this EULA,
or if you desire to contact MPSTOR for any reason, please contact MPSTOR
Inc at eula@mpstor.com
